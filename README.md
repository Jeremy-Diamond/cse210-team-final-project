# Final Project - Mine Sweeper
THis is a game where using logic and a bit of luck you can clear the board of all of the mines.  Hopfully without getting blown up first! 

## Getting Started
---
Make sure you have Python 3.8.0 or newer and Arcade 2.1 or newer installed 
and running on your machine. You can install Asciimatics by opening a terminal 
and running the following command.
```
$ python -m pip install arcade
```
After you've installed the required libraries, open a terminal and browse to the 
project's root folder. Start the program by running the following command.
```
python3 minesweeper 
```
You can also run the program from an IDE like Visual Studio Code. Start your IDE 
and open the project folder. Select the main module inside the hunter folder and 
click the "run" icon.
